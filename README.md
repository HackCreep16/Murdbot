2. Navigate to the "Bot" tab, then click on "Add bot".
3. Navigate to "Oauth2" then copy your client secret, then go to "URL generator".
4. Click on the "Bot" scope, then click on the "administrator" permission.
5. Edit main.py then find "client.run('')" and replace "\[Insert token here]" with your token.
6. Open up cmd or terminal and type these commands.
7. Installing requirements:
