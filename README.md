# Murdbot
A discord bot that I've been working on, its still a work in progress. It's pretty bad, yeah.
> It's gonna to be a multipurpose bot, with alotta fun stuff and something, so yeah, that sums it up.

#

If you want to use it (idk why), just navigate to the root directory of the bot and run this command.
Make sure you're running python 3.6.5 or your computer will explode.

```pip install -r requirements. txt```
