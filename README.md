# Murdbot
A discord bot that I've been working on, its still a work in progress. It's pretty bad, yeah.

Want to invite it? Here's the link: https://discord.com/api/oauth2/authorize?client_id=861264787916324865&permissions=8&scope=bot
Don't worry, it wont destroy your server, and it's not really fully functional yet.

#

If you want to use it (idk why), just navigate to the root directory of the bot and run this command.
Make sure you're running python 3.6.5 or your computer will explode.

`pip install -r requirements. txt`
