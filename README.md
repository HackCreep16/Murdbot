# Murdbot
A discord bot that I've been working on, its still a work in progress. It's pretty bad, yeah.

#
If you want to use it (idk why), just navigate to the root directory of the bot and run this command.
Make sure you're running python 3.6.5 or your computer will explode.

`pip install -r requirements. txt`
